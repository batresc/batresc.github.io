							<h2> <strong> << About Me >> </strong> </h2>
						</header>
						<p> Born and raised in Humboldt County, I was bless to grow among the redwoods and a lush artist community. Along the way of my education career I was fortunate to attend a presentation by a frontend designer and engineer that touched on the topic of UX and UI. After that my goal to aquire the skills to aid my passion in design and tech began. I strongly believe that the goal of facilitating human interaction and providing a clean and effective design is behind a successful product.</p>

						<h2><b> Latest Project:</b> Citing Insights</h2>
						<h3>[UI/UX DESIGNER]</h3>
						<p> We are developing tools to help assess information literacy and citations in student papers. The goal of this project is to help facilitate the student research and writing process by providing a web application that c automatically detects the citations in the paper, enabling one click access to the sources of citations via Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar, or a libraryâ€™s discovery system. User can also evaluate the paper and citations using the built in Information Literacy or Critical Thinking Value rubrics from the AAC&U, or create and edit their own rubrics, and even add annotations. </p>

								<h4>WIREFRAMING & USERFLOW</h4>
								<p>The concept of each page/interaction is carefully explored through the static method of wireframing in various stages (low, mid, high). This only after a user flow that represents all the possible paths a user (persona) could take.  </p>

								<h4>SCRUM</h4>
								<p>The CI team uses iterative and incremental design to make progress through successive refinement and improve upon each sprint. This agile process allows the team to revist and improve details as it moves forward.</p>

								<h4>SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE</h4>
								<p>What worked well? What can be improved? Each meeting within the sprint retrospective is committed to analyzing the success, issues, and potential solutions during each sprint. During this collabrative meeting the backlog and importance of each one is also discussed.</p>

								<h4>ALPHA/BETA TESTING</h4>
								<p>Because this web app is primarily funded and created to help education institutes, the testing is able to be executed in the founding university. Each stage of testing is composed of faculty reviewing and feedback as the team goes through various stages of developement.</p>
